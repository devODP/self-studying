Project Description:

Create four libraries in a city, so that a local resident can use a public computer 
to find out book-related information from these libraries. In addition, these four 
libraries have their own relationships (e.g library 1 may borrow books from library 2 and so on). 

In addition to the four libraries, there is also another online books sharer in the city.
In order to prevent potential copyright lawsuits from publishing books online, the online sharer
moves around the city frequently to hide his IP address from the police.

There is a police in the city.


Objective: Implement the description above using knowledge from Algorithm, Computer Networking, 
           Concurrency, Database management and possibly machine learning or game theory
           
           
          

Components:
"library" - has a database, allows residents to look up books related information through an interactive webpage, 
            the webpage will be created using AngularJS
            
"police" - moves around the city, has an ID, has a tracker to track the sharer

"sharer" - moves around the city, has an IP address, can also have relationships with the four libraries

"public computer" - client that accesses to the servers of the four libraries


"Tracker" - the police may learn the pattern of how the sharer moves around the city, and the sharer
                may learn to escape from the police knowing that the police's strategy
                
"City" - simple 2D array with the boundary columns and rows set to 1 to mimic boundaries
